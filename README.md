  How to use Git, WebStorm, and GitHub together
  </h2>
  1. First you must install Git and WebStorm on you local machine.
  You must also create an account on GitHub.<br>
  Use the following links in order to accomplish this: <br>
  <i>Git</i>: https://git-scm.com/downloads<br>
  <i>WebStorm</i>: https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ <br>
  <i>GitHub</i>: https://github.com/join <br><br>
  2. Open WebStorm and go to System Preferences using 
  <strong>Crtl+Alt+s</strong>. Under <strong>Version Control</strong>,
  select <strong>Git</strong> and enter the path to <strong>Git.exe</strong>.
  This will connect WebStorm to GitHub.<br><br>
  3. Login to your GitHub account. Use the <strong>+</strong> plus symbol
  to add a new Repository. Make the repository public and add the README
  file. Once you have done all this, click <strong>Create</strong>.<br><br>
  4. In WebStorm, use the VCS dropdown menu at the top of the program to
  select <strong>Import into Version Control</strong>. Select 
  <strong>Create Git Repository</strong> and give it an appropriate name.<br><br>
  5.To import the Repository from GitHub into the newly created Git 
  Repository, select <strong>Get From Version Control</strong> under the VCS dropdown menu
  and enter the URL of the Repository from GitHub.<br><br>
  6. With you Repository set up, you can add files in WebStorm using the File
  dropdown menu. Select New and the desired file format.<br><br>
  7. Once you have finished working on a file in, apply your changes using
  the Commit button in WebStorm. Use the shortcut <strong>Crtl+k</strong>.
  In addition, the Commit message should give a brief description
  of what was done to the file.<br><br>
  8. Finally, committed files can now be added to your GitHub Repository
  using the Push function. Use the shortcut <strong>Crtl+Shift+k</strong> to bring up the
  <strong>Push Commits window</strong>. Review all committed files before pushing them using
  <strong>Push</strong> button. You can now see all changes on your GitHub profile.
